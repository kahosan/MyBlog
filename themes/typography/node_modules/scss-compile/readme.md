# scss-compile

A simple npm package to compile SCSS into readable CSS

### Installation

Installation is super simple. Just run:
    
    npm install -g scss-compile

That's it!

## Usage

Running the package is also super easy. Once installed globally, you can run it from any directory. Just run:
   
     npm run scss-compile

## Additional Info

Depending on how you lay out your file structure, you will need to edit the `package.json` file. You'll have to edit the path next to the `"scss-compile"` command. 

### Example

This is the default path structure. I keep my styles located in an `assets` folder. If youre path is different, simply edit the starting point of the path
   
     ...
    "devDependencies": {},
    "scripts": {
      "test": "npm run scss-compile",

      "scss-compile": "node-sass -rw assets/scss -o assets/css",

      "watch": "npm run scss-compile"
     },
    ...

    ...
    "devDependencies": {};
    "scripts": {
      "test": "npm run scss-compile",

      "scss-compile": "node-sass -rw assets/stylesheets/scss -o assets/stylesheets/css".
      
      "watch": "npm run scss-compile"
    },
    ....

You can also edit the output path to wherever you want. Just edit the `assets/css` path in the `package.json` file.
